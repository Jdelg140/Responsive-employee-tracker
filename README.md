# Responsive-employee-tracker

For this assignment I created a employee tracker using SQl,mySQL and, node.js, the user is prompted with questions to either view or edit employees,departments, or the roles for employees. When the user selects to view any of the charts with the selected choice it is displayed in the terminal and shows the user the chart or the additions, editing they made to the charts accordingly.
